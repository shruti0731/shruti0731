Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate and driven final-year B.Tech CSE student specializing in backend development. My journey in technology is fueled by a love for building robust, scalable and efficient systems. I thrive on the challenge of transforming complex problems into clean, elegant code and have a deep appreciation for the architecture that powers modern applications.

My expertise lies in the Java ecosystem, with a strong focus on **Spring Boot** for building powerful backend services. While my heart is in the backend, I also have experience with **React js** for creating dynamic frontends and **MySQL** for managing data. I am a lifelong learner, always exploring new technologies and best practices to push the boundaries of what I can build.

I am actively seeking full-time opportunities where I can contribute to a great team and continue to grow as a developer.
